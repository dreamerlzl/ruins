# before interviewing
- things to know before interviewing a company
  - how many rounds & how they would be scheduled
    - e.g. Microsoft will arrange 3-4 rounds of interview in one day
    - e.g. Zoom only schedules interviews from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m and 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.
  - recent news of the company
    - linkedin social, maimai, teamblind, etc.
    - e.g. when I am interviewing Zoom & Crypto.com, they are buidling new teams and hiring crazily
      - feedback is fast and more HCs
- you may not perform well during your first or second interview
  - I felt very nervous during my first one and performed pretty bad
  - probably not a good idea to start with your dream company!
- if you get an offer and there is a short deadline
  - **it's OK to accept it first and then renege**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# leetcode grind
- get a rough idea about what leetcode challenges the company would give you
- I don't follow the traditional path of preparing for leetcode
  - for each topic, I would only spend 5-10 mins for each problem
  - then I just go to the solutions directly, analyze and remember the pattern
  - after going through 5-10 problems, I will try to solve some new problems by adapting the newly learned pattern
  - in this way, you could prepare for a lot of common & classic problems in a short time
  - this method is originally proposed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6luszf/a_leetcode_grinding_guide/)
- I also find [grokking the coding interview](https://1lib.tw/book/16346646/98e271) very helpful
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# questions to ask during interviews
- **MUST** ask questions to show your interest in the position and the company
- aspects
  - if you want to find a less stressful job, ask the following
    - management style(micro/macro), report frequency(weekly, monthly or daily?)
    - how performance review is conducted, KPI/OKR (ask about the frequencey)?
    - what kind of meetings happen per week?
    - **release period**(being too short may indicate heavy workload)
    - what keeps you at the company? what do you like the least?
  - role & position
    - any on call?
    - daily tasks of the position
    - success definitions during the probation period
    - tech stacks
  - practice
    - bug fix, refactoring, rollback (**you would get some insights about the tech debts of the team**)

# my experience
## Microsoft
- the first round is an HR phone interview
  - expected salary, why you leave, your career goals
- there is a medium leetcode per technical round
  - either the exact same problem on leetcode or a variant
- the interviewer would be glad to see you design the test cases first
  - to clarify the question
  - Microsoft team value Test Driven Development (they have no quality assurance)
- if you are not very confident during the leetcode challenge, talk to your interviewers!
  - they are not your enemies and would sometimes give you hints
- around 35 mins for you to finish it
- if you are not a new grad, there will be questions related to your past experience
  - only talk about the highlights
  - prepare how to explain your project and role in English

### offer
- the offer would be permanent
  - i.e. 不是多少年，而是一签就是终生雇佣
- 15 paid leave + 15 sick leave

## Crypto.com
- a global blockchain financial company
  - allows remote or hybrid working
- the Shenzhen base is hiring backend & client dev for Crypto Wallet
- the interviewers care a lot about your understanding of the crypto industry
  - the business model
  - future directions and growth
- no leetcode, but system design and project experience
  - the system design problem is about high concurrency, high availability and distributed transactions

### offer
- cryptos for employees outside mainland China
  - cash (10% of your annual package) instead for mainland employees
- bonus based on your performance: 0-4 months
- 3 day wfh per week

## Zoom
- like crypto.com, system design + project experience + questions related to the position
  - you need to solve leetcode in only 1 round
- 2 separate technical interviews
- Zoom's HRs are very professional and value thorough communication
  - ask much as you can

### offer
- 1 day wfh per week
- 10 paid leave + 20 sick leave
- a large portion of the package is restricted stock units

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# getting the offer
- go to others for help
  - salary negotation
  - how to renege a offer
  - how to communicate with HR in a proper way
    - **I did lose an offer because of this, by asking too many trifle questions**
- check teamblind, indeed company ratings or maimai to get more info about the department
  - e.g. in maimai, some ex-microsofter list the departments where heavy workload and overtime are common
